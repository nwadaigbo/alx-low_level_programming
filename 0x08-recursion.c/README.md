##C - Recursion
This project shows what I learned about recursion in C.

Tasks
She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

0-puts_recursion.c: C function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char s);
Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

1-print_rev_recursion.c: C function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char s);
Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

2-strlen_recursion.c: C function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char s);
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

3-factorial.c: C function that returns the factorial of a given number.
Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

4-pow_recursion.c: C function that returns the value of a number x raised to the value of an input y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);

If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.

Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

5-sqrt_recursion.c: C function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);

If the number does not have a natural square root, the function returns -1.

Inception. Is it possible?

6-is_prime_number.c: C function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);

They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

100-is_palindrome.c: C function that checks if a string is a palindrome.

If the string is a palindrome, the function returns 1,otherwise, the function returns 0.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(char s);

Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

101-wildcmp.c: C function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

s2 can contain the special character *.

The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)

If the strings can be considered identical, the function returns , otherwise, the function returns 0.
