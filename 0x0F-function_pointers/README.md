##C - Function pointers
This project is about function pointers in C - what they hold, where they point in virtual memory, and how to use them.

function_pointers.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written for programs 0-2 of the project.
Tasks
What's my name

0-print_name.c: C function that prints a name.
Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));
If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

1-array_iterator.c: C function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));
where size is the size of the array
and action is a pointer to the function you need to use
To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

2-int_index.c: C function that searches for an integer.
Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));
where size is the number of elements in the array array
cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
If no element matches, return -1
If size <= 0, return -1
A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at

3-op_functions.c: File containing the following five functions:

- op_add: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- op_sub: Returns the difference of `a` and `b`.
- op_mul: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- op_div: Returns the division of `a` by `b`.
- op_mod: Returns the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`.
3-get_op_func.c: C function that selects the correct function from 3-op_functions.c to perform the operation asked by the user. - Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int); - where s is the operator passed as argument to the program - This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add - You are not allowed to use switch statements - You are not allowed to use for or do ... while loops - You are not allowed to use goto - You are not allowed to use else - You are not allowed to use more than one if statement in your code - You are not allowed to use more than one while loop in your code - If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL - You are only allowed to declare these two variables in this function:

3-main.c: C program that performs simple mathematical operations. - You are not allowed to code any other function than main in this file - You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function - You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int - You are not allowed to use any kind of loop - You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements

Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker

[100-main_opcodes.c]: C program that prints the opcodes of its own main function, followed by a new line.
Usage: ./main number_of_bytes
Output format:
the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase
each opcode is two char long
listing ends with a new line
see example
You are allowed to use printf and atoi
You have to use atoi to convert the argument to an int
If the number of argument is not the correct one, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If the number of bytes is negative, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 2
You do not have to compile with any flags
